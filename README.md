# Connect-4-with-AI

The AI that was implemented here uses a Minimax algorithm where it will consider all of the possible moves that it could make and then for those moves it considers all of the possible moves that the opponent could make and so on until it reaches a certain depth. After that it will then analyse the position and give it an evaluation and the Ai will play the move that give it the best evaluation
